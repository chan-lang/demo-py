# Permissions-Driven Demo

The [`main.py`](main.py) file demonstrates the basic principles of the
Permissions-Driven paradigm. I achieved it with some trickery and function
aliases recorded in the [`chan.py`](chan.py) module.

> I do not recommend that you use this as a production model as Python does not
> enforce these permission constraints.

If you are passionate about this approach to programming, you are more than
welcome to contribute to this project!
